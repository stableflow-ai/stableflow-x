              </p>
              <ul>

              <p>
                Please note that we are not responsible for (i) your use of Ethereum or any other blockchain and (ii) the use of your personal data as processed in these decentralized and permissionless blockchain networks. Your private key which you utilize to access your Ethereum or other blockchain funds and initiate transactions is stored only on your own device.
              </p>
              <p>
                You should also be aware that due to the inherent transparency of the blockchain networks, transactions that you approve when using the Interface may be publicly accessible. This includes, but is not limited to, your public sending address, the public address of the receiver, the amount sent or received, and any other data a user has chosen to include in a given transaction. Transactions and addresses available on blockchain may reveal personal data about the user's identity, and personal data can potentially be correlated now or in the future by any party who chooses to do so, including law enforcement. In addition, we may process publicly available data, including information obtained through blockchain intelligence and analytics services. This may involve analyzing blockchain transactions, wallet addresses, and other data accessible on public blockchains or related platforms to enhance the functionality of the Services, ensure security, and provide insights into blockchain activities. Certain elements, when combined with other information, may reveal your identity.
              </p>
              <p>
                We encourage you to review how privacy and transparency on the blockchain network work.
              </p>

              <h3>Why we may use your personal data</h3>

              </p>
              <ul>

              <h3>Disclosure of Data</h3>

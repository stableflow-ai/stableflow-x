              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>"1Click Service"</strong> or <strong>"1CS"</strong>: A separate integration and service that facilitates simplified routing to the Protocol for certain Intents and may interact with Third-Party bridges, known as "1Click Service", "1Click Swap" or "1CS". 1CS is not part of the Interface and is not operated by the Company. Further details can be found at: <a href="https://docs.near-intents.org/near-intents/integration/distribution-channels/1click-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.near-intents.org/near-intents/integration/distribution-channels/1click-api</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>"Third-Party Bridges"</strong> or <strong>"Bridges"</strong>: Collectively, the PoA Bridge, the HOT Bridge, and the Omni Bridge, and any other bridges integrated with the Protocol and/or Interface from time to time.

              <p>
                <strong>"CCTP"</strong>: A protocol operated by Circle that enables native USDC transfers across supported chains by burning USDC on the source chain and minting the same amount on the destination chain. CCTP is provided and operated by third parties and is not part of the Protocol, Interface, or 1Click Service. Any interaction with CCTP is subject to such third parties' terms and systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>"USDT0"</strong>: A cross-chain representation of USDT created using a lock-and-mint model under the OFT standard. Canonical USDT is locked on Ethereum, and an equivalent amount of USDT0 is minted on supported chains, maintaining 1:1 backing. USDT0 may be redeemed by burning the token on any supported chain to unlock the corresponding USDT on Ethereum. USDT0 is provided and operated by third parties and is not part of the Protocol, Interface, or 1Click Service. Any interaction with USDT0 is subject to such third parties' terms and systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>"Third-Party Cross-Chain Services"</strong>: Collectively, the Third-Party Bridges, CCTP, USDT0 rails, and any other third-party cross-chain messaging, bridging, or lock-and-mint solutions integrated with the Protocol and/or the Interface from time to time.

              </p>

              <h2>2. The Interface</h2>
              <p>
                The main purpose of the Interface is to provide you with access to the Protocol. We only provide the interface and software but have no control over your blockchain interactions and do not endorse any specific actions. All the transactions occur on third-party blockchains ("<strong>Blockchain Networks</strong>") that we do not own, control, or operate. We are not responsible for the services provided by third parties, the execution of the transactions, or any other actions of such third parties. We reserve the right to make changes to the Interface, including adding, modifying, or discontinuing products or features.
              </p>
              <p>
                Products and Features. The Interface integrates the Protocol, which in turn integrates other protocols and offers you access to numerous liquidity sources across multiple chains. The Interface may include other products and/or features added for the purposes of user experience development and improvement, including those for the informational, security, and entertainment purposes, which are not intended to affect the main purpose of the Interface described above. We only provide you with access to the relevant interface and software and neither have control over your interactions with the blockchain or the Protocol nor do we encourage you to perform any. Any interaction performed by you via the Interface remains your sole responsibility.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Interface is a non-custodial tool that enable users to interact with the Protocol by providing web or mobile-based access. Through the Interface, users can declare desired outcomes (Intents) on various public blockchains, including but not limited to NEAR, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Solana. These Intents are broadcasted to the Solver Network that independently analyze and compete to execute the Intents through optimal pathways across supported blockchains.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Interface is designed to simplify blockchain interactions by allowing users, services, or AI agents to declare high-level outcomes they wish to achieve, rather than specifying the technical steps required.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Interface revolves around the concept of "intents," which are structured declarations containing key details such as the initiator's NEAR account ID, the type of intent (e.g., token swap, transfer), source assets and amounts, desired outcomes, unique identifiers for tracking, and optional constraints like deadlines or minimum outputs. These intents are broadcasted to a Solver Network, where Solvers analyze and compete to provide an execution plan. Once a user approves a Solver's quote, the Intent is executed via a smart contract on NEAR (intents.near) (being the Protocol), which handles the transaction - including cross-chain operations if necessary - while ensuring state changes are verified and reported back to the originator. This abstraction streamlines complex blockchain processes into an intuitive and efficient user experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Interface is distinct from the Protocol and is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol. <strong>The Company does not control or operate any version of the Protocol on any Blockchain Network.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                By using the Interface, you understand that you are not buying or selling digital assets from us and that we do not operate any liquidity pools on the Protocol or control trade execution on the Protocol. When users pay fees for trades, and/or any Slippage, those fees may accrue to Solvers, Liquidity Providers and Relayers for the Protocol. As a general matter, Solvers, Liquidity providers and Relayers are independent third parties. We may charge an Interface Fee (as described below in clause 2.2).
              </p>
              <p>
                The Protocol (i.e., the NEAR Intent Protocol) is maintained via a multi-signature governance mechanism involving multiple independent participants who are not controlled by the Company. Participation by any person or entity in such governance (whether or not the Company or its affiliates are among them at any time) does not create any duty or obligation to users. No individual participant can unilaterally upgrade or otherwise control the Protocol. The Company is not the developer, owner, or operator of the Protocol.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the Protocol is deployed on the NEAR Protocol, it is integrated with various Third-Party Cross-Chain Services to enable cross-chain functionality. The Third-Party Cross-Chain Services facilitate asset transfers between NEAR and supported networks (including, by way of example, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Solana and others), whether via lock-and-mint bridges (such as the Third-Party Bridges and USDT0 rails) or burn-and-mint mechanisms (such as CCTP). This allows non-NEAR-native assets to be bridged onto NEAR for settlement by the Protocol, and assets to be withdrawn from NEAR to a non-NEAR destination chain post-settlement.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Third-Party Cross-Chain Services are integrated with, but are not part of, the Protocol or the Interface. They are operated by independent third parties, not the Company. Your relationship with any Third-Party Cross-Chain Service provider is governed by the applicable terms of service of that provider. We do not have custody or control over any Third-Party Cross-Chain Services. You are solely responsible for evaluating and accepting the risks of using any Third-Party Cross-Chain Service, including risks of software vulnerabilities, governance failures, hacks, message-passing failures, or loss of assets.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, the 1Click Service is a separate service that provides a simplified user experience for interacting with the Protocol. The 1Click Service handles routing of intents, bridging, and settlement steps in a streamlined fashion, abstracting away the technical steps from the user.
              </p>
              <p>
                The 1Click Service is an integration with the Protocol but is not itself part of the Protocol or the Interfaces, and it is not operated by the Company. It is operated by third parties. Your use of the 1Click Service may be subject to its own terms of service and risks. We do not have custody or control over the 1Click Service. You are solely responsible for evaluating and accepting the risks of using the 1Click Service, including any risks of downtime, misconfiguration, or loss of assets.
              </p>
              <p>
                To access the Interface, you must use a non-custodial wallet software, which allows you to interact with public blockchains. Your relationship with that non-custodial wallet provider is governed by the applicable terms of service of that wallet provider. We do not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and have no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. By connecting your wallet to the Interface, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and all of the terms incorporated herein by reference.
              </p>
              <p>
                Solvers are independent actors, and Company does not:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>(a) Guarantee optimal pricing or execution;</li>
                <li>(b) Assess Solvers' reliability or security;</li>
                <li>(c) Insure against losses from Solver errors, collusion, or malicious acts.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Solver Network includes AI-driven, algorithmic-driven and human-operated Solvers. AI Solvers may exhibit limitations including algorithmic biases, unpredictable behaviors under certain conditions, or optimization approaches that prioritize different factors than you might expect. The Company does not develop, control, or validate the decision-making processes of individual Solvers and assumes no responsibility for their performance or outcomes.
              </p>
              <p>
                To the extent that you elect to conduct transactions in connection with the Interface, all transactions are conducted between you and the relevant third party (Solver Network) and the Company is not a party to them. The Company is not responsible for the quality, safety, accuracy, or any aspect of the transaction (regardless of whether such transaction is made available by the Interface) save where expressly indicated.
              </p>

              <h3>2.1. Interface Fee</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>2.1.1. Interface Fee:</strong> In consideration for providing, operating, and improving the Interfaces, we may charge a fee on certain transactions routed through the Interfaces (the "Interface Fee"). The applicability, amount, or rate of any Interface Fee may vary depending on transaction type or other factors and may change from time to time at our discretion. The Interface Fee applies solely to use of the Interfaces and does not alter or affect execution of the Protocol. The applicable Interface Fee will be clearly disclosed through the Interface at or before the time you authorise a transaction. You are solely responsible for paying any Interface Fee associated with your transactions. Interface Fees are generally non-refundable once a transaction is submitted and may not be refundable if a transaction fails, is reverted, or does not complete as expected, except where required by applicable law.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>2.1.2. Protocol and Solver Fees:</strong> Transactions routed through Protocol may also be subject to additional protocol-level charges, including (i) solver incentives, (ii) protocol fees, (iii) liquidity pool or liquidity provider (LP) fees, and (iv) any other protocol-level or execution-related fees. These fees are not retained by us and form part of the protocol-driven execution costs.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>2.1.3. Gas / Network Fees.</strong> All blockchain transactions require network transaction fees (e.g., "gas") paid to the applicable network. You are solely responsible for gas and related network costs. Gas is set by the network and is non-refundable, including for transactions that fail or are reverted by the network or smart contract.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>2.1.4.

                As between you and us, the Interface and their proprietary elements, including, but not limited to, software, text, images, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, and designs, other than open-source components, are owned by our licensors and are licensed to us.

Users may fork and modify the open-source code in accordance with the MIT License, but may not use the Company's trademarks or branding in derivative works without permission. Your use of the hosted Interface provided by the Company is governed by these Terms, while any independent deployment of the open-source code is governed by the applicable open-source license. You will retain ownership of all intellectual property and other rights in any information and materials you submit through the Interface.

                Specifically, your use of the Interface or the Protocol may result in various tax consequences, such as income or capital gains tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, or sales tax in certain jurisdictions. It is your responsibility to determine whether taxes apply to any transactions you initiate or receive and, if so, to report and/or remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. It is recommended that you consult a tax professional to understand the tax implications of your transactions, as cryptocurrency and cross-chain transactions can be complex and vary by jurisdiction.

                6.5. Gas Fees, Price Estimates, and Slippage
              </h3>
              <p>
                Blockchain transactions require the payment of transaction fees to the appropriate network ("<strong>Gas Fees</strong>"). Except as otherwise expressly set forth in the terms of another offer by the Company, you will be solely responsible to pay the Gas Fees for any transaction that you initiate via any of the Interface. Although we attempt to provide accurate fee information, this information reflects our estimates of fees, which may vary from the actual fees paid to use the Interface and interact with the NEAR, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Solana, and other blockchains.
              </p>
              <p>
                When executing trades through the Interface, you may experience Slippage – the difference between the quoted price and the execution price. Slippage may be more pronounced in cross-chain transactions where market conditions may change during the settlement period. You acknowledge that the final execution price may differ from the initially displayed quote, and that neither the Company nor the Protocol guarantees execution at the quoted price.

              <h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
              <h3>7.1. Assumption of Risk -- Generally</h3>
              <p>
                The Company does not operate a digital asset or derivatives exchange platform or offer trade execution or clearing services and has no oversight, involvement, or control concerning your transactions using the Interface. All transactions between users of the Interface are executed peer-to-peer directly between the users' addresses through smart contracts and the Protocol. You are responsible for complying with all applicable laws that govern your digital assets.
              </p>
              <p>
                By accessing and using any part of the Interface, you represent that you are financially and technically sophisticated enough to understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the use, transfer, custody, and settlement of stablecoins and related blockchain transactions. You further acknowledge familiarity with tokenized representations of value issued on public blockchain networks, including tokens implemented under common standards (such as ERC-20, NEP-141, or similar standards), and the operational, technological, and regulatory considerations applicable to such digital assets.
              </p>
              <p>
                You acknowledge and understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems and blockchain-based networks. The Company does not own or control any of the underlying software through which blockchain networks are formed. In general, the software underlying blockchain networks, including the NEAR, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Solana, and TON blockchains (this list is non-exhaustive and includes any and all open-source blockchains), is open-source, such that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute it. By using the Interface, you acknowledge and agree (a) that the Company is not responsible for the operation of the blockchain-based software and networks underlying the Interface, (b) that there exists no guarantee of the functionality, security, or availability of that software and networks, and (c) that the underlying blockchain-based networks are subject to sudden changes in operating rules, such as those commonly referred to as "forks," which may materially affect the Interface. Blockchain networks use public and private key cryptography. You alone are responsible for securing your private key(s). We do not have access to your private key(s). Losing control of your private key(s) will permanently and irreversibly deny you access to digital assets on the NEAR, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Solana, and TON blockchains or other blockchain-based networks. Neither the Company, the Protocol nor any other person or entity will be able to retrieve or protect your digital assets. If your private key(s) are lost, then you will not be able to transfer your digital assets to any other blockchain address or wallet. If this occurs, then you will not be able to realize any value or utility from the digital assets that you may hold.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further, you acknowledge and understand that the markets for these digital assets are nascent and highly volatile due to risk factors including, but not limited to, adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You understand that anyone can create a token, including fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that falsely claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and understand the risk that you may mistakenly trade those or other tokens. So-called stablecoins may not be as stable as they purport to be, may not be fully or adequately collateralized, and may be subject to panics and runs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The information displayed through the Interface and information about prices or other are provided by third parties and/or calculated for informational purposes and we do not provide any warranties for such information.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further, you acknowledge and understand that smart contract transactions automatically execute and settle, and that blockchain-based transactions are irreversible when confirmed. You acknowledge and understand that you are responsible for all trades you place, including any erroneous orders that may be filled. We do not take any action to resolve erroneous trades that result from your errors. You acknowledge and understand that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as NEAR, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Solana, TON and others are variable and may increase dramatically at any time. You further acknowledge and understand the risk of selecting to trade in expert modes, which can expose you to potentially significant price slippage and higher costs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further, you acknowledge and understand that the Interface and your digital assets could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of the Company to continue to make available our proprietary software and could impede or limit your ability to access or use the Interface.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further, you acknowledge and understand that cryptography is a progressing field with advances in code cracking or other technical advancements, such as the development of quantum computers, which may present risks to digital assets and the Interface, and could result in the theft or loss of your digital assets. To the extent possible, the smart contracts available on the interface will be updated to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures necessary to address risks presented from technological advancements, but that intention does not guarantee or otherwise ensure full security of the Interface.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further, you understand that NEAR, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Solana, TON and other blockchain-based networks remain under development, which creates technological and security risks when using the Interface in addition to uncertainty relating to digital assets and transactions therein. You acknowledge that the cost of transacting on the NEAR, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Solana, TON and other blockchain-based networks is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any activities taking place on NEAR, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Solana, TON or other blockchain-based networks, which may result in price fluctuations or increased costs when using the Interface.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further, you acknowledge and understand that the Interface are subject to flaws and that you are solely responsible for evaluating any code provided relating to the Interface. This warning and other warnings that the Company provides in these terms are in no way evidence or represent an on-going duty to alert you to all of the potential risks of utilizing the Interface. Although we intend to provide accurate and timely information and data, information available when using the Interface may not always be entirely accurate, complete, or current and may also include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. To continue to provide you with as complete and accurate information as possible, information may be changed or updated from time to time without notice, including information regarding our policies. Accordingly, you acknowledge and understand that you should verify all information before relying on it, and all decisions based on information listed on the Interface are your sole responsibility. No representation is made as to the accuracy, completeness, or appropriateness for any particular purpose of any pricing information distributed via the site or otherwise when using the Interface. Prices and pricing information may be higher or lower than prices available on platforms providing similar services.
              </p>
              <p>
                We must comply with applicable laws, which may require us to, upon request by government agencies, take certain actions or provide information. You acknowledge and understand that the Company may in its sole discretion take any action it deems appropriate to cooperate with government agencies or comply with applicable laws.
              </p>
              <p>
                The users acknowledge that transactions executed through the Interface may experience Slippage, resulting in a final execution price different from the initially displayed price. Slippage is inherent to cross chain transactions due to factors such as market volatility, liquidity fluctuations, and blockchain transaction delays. The Company and the Protocol do not control or influence the price at which transactions are executed and are not responsible for any financial losses resulting from slippage.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, the Interface, by providing access to the Protocol, facilitates cross-chain transactions through Third-Party Cross-Chain Services (including, without limitation, the Third-Party Bridges, CCTP, and USDT0 rails), which are integrated with, but separate to, the Protocol. These Third-Party Cross-Chain Services carry inherent risks, including but not limited to smart contract vulnerabilities, governance risks, message-passing failures, and the potential for asset loss due to bridge or lock-and-mint failures or exploits. In particular, the Omni Bridge and HOT Bridge leverage Chain Signatures, which depend on cryptographic assumptions vulnerable to technological advances (e.g., quantum computing), while CCTP relies on third-party smart contracts and messaging operated by Circle, and USDT0 rails rely on lock-and-mint mechanics and OFT-based infrastructure on Ethereum and destination chains. Compromised signatures, contract failures, messaging failures, or other vulnerabilities may result in irreversible asset loss. The Company does not control any of the Third-Party Cross-Chain Services or Chain Signatures and disclaims any liability for any losses or damages resulting from their respective use.
              </p>
              <p>
                In summary, you acknowledge that We are not responsible for any of these variables or risks, do not own or control the Protocol, the 1ClickService, or the Third-Party Bridges, and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing or using any of the Interface. Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using the Interface to interact with the Protocol. You hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge all claims, whether known or unknown to you, against the Company and Our shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents, and representatives, suppliers, and contractors related to any of the risks set forth in this Section 7 or elsewhere in these terms.
